                        I’m a half Thai half Filipino from New Zealand who moved to Australia in 2010. At home we only speak English although there was an attempt made to teach my 2 brothers and I Thai. I was classically taught guitar but now mainly look online for sheet music for music I enjoy. I also enjoy playing video games favoured more towards turn based strategy and RPGs. I have an interest in video games and data science with video games sparking my interest in IT. I have previously used GameSalad to recreate a basic game of Asteroids in my later years of primary school and went on to study VCE computing at East Doncaster Secondary College. As for my interest in data science I have found it interesting as to how data can be studied and applied.</p>

                        Greetings!
                        My name is Yew Zen Jet or you could call me Jason or any one word from my name ^^.
                        My student ID is S3928350, if you have any questions or thoughts about me, feel free to email me at s3928350@student.rmit.edu.au.
                        My nationality is Malaysian and I just came to Australia in end of May 2022. I studied SACEi in Taylor College Malaysia (which is equivalent to Year 12 in Australia) and was lucky enough that RMIT provided free program for the course students during our mid-term break. The program is called RMIT GSSP (Global Summer School Program). That is why I’ve decided to join RMIT in Australia.
                        My current hobbies are gardening, cooking and skateboarding. Though I wouldn’t say I’m very good at any of my hobbies especially skateboarding as I’ve just started learning few weeks ago, I’m very passionate on improving the skillset needed for my hobbies.
                        Personally, my interest in IT is more towards program developing or machine learning. However, we never know whether I will continue in this IT area or change my IT interest along the way during my study.
                        I don’t have much IT experience since I never really put myself in the IT world but I would say I know some programming language myself. For example, I know HTML, CSS, some Javascript and some Python. Furthermore, I’m currently taking courses such as Intro to Information Technology, Intro to Computer System, Practical Database Concepts and Web Programming in my 1st year 1st sem.

        <h3>Group Processes</h3>
      <b>  How are we changing things from A2 to A3 (collaboration)</b>
<p>We are changing our group process to be more active and communicative compared to our previous collaboration work. This is intended to counter our weaknesses in our teamwork/group process in A2, mainly procrastination and the lack of meaningful communications in the early phases of our assignment.
We will divide and clearly note the work sections for each member to work more efficiently.</p>

<p>At the end of the assignment, we hope to achieve an outstanding result in our A3 project after the change in our group work process</p>

        <h3>Career Plans</h3>
        <p><strong>Timothy</strong></p>

  <p>While completing my degree here at RMIT I will hone my programming skills which will help me for programming related jobs in the future as with many programming languages similar concepts can be projected onto others. In particular I would like to focus on languages such as Python and R which are commonly used with data visualisation. This would mean that I would need to understand in depth how algorithms work in order to properly use these tools. Building a strong foundation is absolutely necessary in order to be successful.</p>

  <p>After completing my degree, I would like to find employment as a junior data scientist at a company in order to gain real practical experience. As I would have no real experience in the workplace, a position as a junior data scientist would be best. A company such as FinXL IT Professional Services which provides data science solutions to its clients would be a great starting point for me. I would be required to learn skills such as data engineering, databases, business analysis and scripting. Whilst gathering experience and knowledge as a junior data scientist I would like to eventually move up to being a senior data scientist either at the same company or at a larger company.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><strong>Reza</strong></p>

  <p>I will continue to learn and improve my web programming skills during my study at RMIT, this along with a Bachelor Degree will help me with my career tremendously when i go back to my country. I still have a lot to learn especially in advanced CSS and JavaScript/JS Library and framework such as React &amp; Nextjs. I will also try to learn more so i can be a full stack developer or maybe a system administrator in the future to further advance my potential career.</p>

  <p>After graduating and getting my degree i plan to find work as junior front end developers in small to medium-sized companies to gain practical experience and skills in the real world. Before this i only have experience volunteering in my father&rsquo;s office as a junior wordpress developer and IT support. After being employed in a junior position i might go for a better employment opportunity or go for a promotion to senior positions with more benefits and responsibilities.</p>

<h2>Tools</h2>
<a href="https://github.com/JasonYew-RMIT/Assignment-3-IIT"> GitHub Respository</a><br>
<a href="https://jasonyew-rmit.github.io/Assignment-3-IIT/">Website</a>

<p>GitHub was used to share the repository with the group members with GitHub Pages being used to host the website with the instructor already being in the Microsoft Team and invited to the repository. As with last time, the commit history is not completely accurate in terms of when something was done due to most of the report being added to the website in the long after it was added to the report. However, similar to last assignment, much of the progress on this assignment was done towards the end of the allotted time.</p>
<p>Through Microsoft Teams we conducted our communication. IT was used to conduct meetings which were recorded with a general structure of a progress report. Aside from meetings it was also used for file sharing, communication outside of meetings and collaboration. We found that in order to bounce ideas off each other, getting in a call for an unstructured meeting would help us progress smoother as opposed to communicating solely through text. Collaborating this way allowed prompted us to share our opinions more easily as we were aware of what the others were doing or looking at.</p>
