                      I’m a half Thai half Filipino from New Zealand who moved to Australia in 2010. At home we only speak English although there was an attempt made to teach my 2 brothers and I Thai. I was classically taught guitar but now mainly look online for sheet music for music I enjoy. I also enjoy playing video games favoured more towards turn based strategy and RPGs. I have an interest in video games and data science with video games sparking my interest in IT. I have previously used GameSalad to recreate a basic game of Asteroids in my later years of primary school and went on to study VCE computing at East Doncaster Secondary College. As for my interest in data science I have found it interesting as to how data can be studied and applied.</p>

                      Hi there, My Name is Brian Ho. I have been living in Melbourne for my entire life as I was born here. I am currently studying for an Associate degree of IT furthermore moving into a Bachelor of IT. This is currently my second year of University. So far I have only 1 year to go. My Student ID is s3898120. I am currently studying this because I feel I have a part in IT as I liked playing with computers since I was young. My hobbies are often repairing things around the house such as lawn mowers, gardening, and cycling.

        <h3>Group Processes</h3>
      <b>  How are we changing things from A2 to A3 (collaboration)</b>
        <p>
          We are changing our group process to be more active and communicative compared to our previous collaboration work. This is intended to counter our weaknesses in our teamwork/group process in A2, mainly procrastination and the lack of meaningful communications in the early phases of our assignment.
          We will divide and clearly note the work sections for each member to work more efficiently.
        </p>

        <p>At the end of the assignment, we hope to achieve an outstanding result in our A3 project after the change in our group work process
        </p>

        <h3>Career Plans</h3>
        <p><strong>Timothy</strong></p>

  <p>While completing my degree here at RMIT I will hone my programming skills which will help me for programming related jobs in the future as with many programming languages similar concepts can be projected onto others. In particular I would like to focus on languages such as Python and R which are commonly used with data visualisation. This would mean that I would need to understand in depth how algorithms work in order to properly use these tools. Building a strong foundation is absolutely necessary in order to be successful.</p>

  <p>After completing my degree, I would like to find employment as a junior data scientist at a company in order to gain real practical experience. As I would have no real experience in the workplace, a position as a junior data scientist would be best. A company such as FinXL IT Professional Services which provides data science solutions to its clients would be a great starting point for me. I would be required to learn skills such as data engineering, databases, business analysis and scripting. Whilst gathering experience and knowledge as a junior data scientist I would like to eventually move up to being a senior data scientist either at the same company or at a larger company.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><strong>Reza</strong></p>

  <p>I will continue to learn and improve my web programming skills during my study at RMIT. This along with a Bachelor Degree will help me with my career tremendously when I go back to my country. I still have a lot to learn especially in advanced CSS and JavaScript/JS Library and frameworks such as React & Nextjs. I will also try to learn more so I can be a full stack developer or maybe a system administrator in the future to further advance my potential career.
  </p>

  <p>After graduating and getting my degree I plan to find work as junior front end developers in small to medium-sized companies to gain practical experience and skills in the real world. Before this I only had experience volunteering in my father’s office as a junior wordpress developer and IT support. After being employed in a junior position I might go for a better employment opportunity or go for a promotion to senior positions with more benefits and responsibilities.</p>

  <p><strong>Fernando</strong></p>
  <p>
    I'm still interested in being a software engineer after I graduate, therefore I need to develop some skills that are related to this job, more specifically programming skills and study some more popular and demanded programming languages such as Java and phyton. These 2 languages are a high demand language by a lot of big companies so by learning and mastering these skills, it will increase my chance to work in big companies and get some experiences.
  </p>
  <p>
    After i finish my study at RMIT, i'm planning to look for a job here in Australia as a software engineer and if i could not find one, i'm planning to apply to tech company in Indonesia such as Tokopedia, Shopee, etc to work or do some kind of internship there and learn a little bit about marketing to increase my chances to get accepted.

  <p><strong>Jason</strong></p>
  <p>
    Currently I am currently studying for a Bachelor of Information and I'm planning to major in software development and probably database as well. This is because i am interested in	backend development and i believe that database administrator  is also a job that is widely in demand for all working areas. 
  </p>
  <p>
    While I'm studying in RMIT I am working in a coaching college as an administrator and I believe I will continue working in the coaching college after I finish my degree. However, i do have couple of jobs that i would like to work in which is Java Backend Developer in AWS

  <p><strong>Brian</strong></p>
  <p>I am currently studying for an Associate Degree in Information Technology for 2 years then transferring over to Bachelor of IT for 1 year. In total, the amount of studying that I would have completed in 3 years. So far I enjoy studying networking, cyber security and databases. I believe that studying these two go hand to hand with each other as I would have to know about networking fundamentals in order to advance into cyber security and databases would be ideal to know as there is a lot of information stored on it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once completing my Bachelor Degree I would like to find a suitable job that fulfils my interests which are the following; networking, cyber security and database. However due to the time constraints of me studying full time, it doesn’t allow the flexibility for me to find a job part time while studying. Most companies out on the job field require me to secure an internship with them full time which is currently impossible to complete at the moment as I would like to finish the course. For me to get started I am researching to apply for junior level jobs or find IT service desk in order to me to get the foot in the door

<h2>Tools</h2>
<a href="https://github.com/JasonYew-RMIT/Assignment-3-IIT"> GitHub Respository</a><br>
<a href="https://jasonyew-rmit.github.io/Assignment-3-IIT/">Website</a>

<p>GitHub was used to share the repository with the group members with GitHub Pages being used to host the website with the instructor already being in the Microsoft Team and invited to the repository. As with last time, the commit history is not completely accurate in terms of when something was done due to most of the report being added to the website in the long after it was added to the report. However, similar to last assignment, much of the progress on this assignment was done towards the end of the allotted time.</p>
<p>Through Microsoft Teams we conducted our communication. IT was used to conduct meetings which were recorded with a general structure of a progress report. Aside from meetings it was also used for file sharing, communication outside of meetings and collaboration. We found that in order to bounce ideas off each other, getting in a call for an unstructured meeting would help us progress smoother as opposed to communicating solely through text. Collaborating this way allowed prompted us to share our opinions more easily as we were aware of what the others were doing or looking at.</p>
